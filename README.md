# Roshn Frontend

A modern React application created using Vite for development. This app uses various libraries for state management, routing, and UI components.

# Description

This React application fetches a list of users from an API and displays them in a table with pagination. When a user is clicked, it navigates to a details page showing more information about the selected user. The app uses React Router for navigation and Redux Toolkit for state management. It implements error handling by retrying the API call up to three times in case of failure, and displays appropriate error messages if the data cannot be loaded.
